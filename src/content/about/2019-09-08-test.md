A hip-hop group act consisting of 3 best friends from Vancouver, Canada. Est. in December 2018, ever since their first release “Never Been the Same,” Un!dentified has been on a mission to affect their audience through evoking emotions from pure excitement to dark reflection. With a mission to escalate the close-to nonexistent hip-hop scene from where they’re from, Un!dentified’s goal is to give back to the culture and fans that have made them.
